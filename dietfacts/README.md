You can directly do:

git checkout <original-remote-branch-name>
This automatically creates a local branch which tracks the remote branch with the same name. Do this always after cloning, if you want to work on a particular branch other than master.

Note: When you clone the remote name is by default 'origin' which is different from the remote name used in other machines where you are developing. So, you can initially name your remote before cloning or push to origin ever after.
